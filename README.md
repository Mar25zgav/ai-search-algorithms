# AI search algorithms

We implemented a few search algorithms on a labyrinth that has an starting node and multiple "treasure" nodes that have to be found before ending in the final node.

- breadth first search (BFS)
- depth first search (DFS)
- A* search algorithm
- Iterative deepening A* (IDA*)
- Iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS)

Visualization was created with StdDraw library.
